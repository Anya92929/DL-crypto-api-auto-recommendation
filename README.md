# DL-crypto-api-auto-recommendation
An open-sourced work for deep learning based solution of cryptographic API recommendation. The directory CryptoSlicer includes the code to extract program slices from Android Apps by inter-procedural backward slicing. The directory Graph_reconstruct includes the program to reconstruct the API dependence graph and extract paths. The directory deep_Learning_experiments includes our code for API recommendtation training and testing, as well as extensive comparisons with intermediate baselines.
